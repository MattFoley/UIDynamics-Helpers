UIDynamics-Helpers
==================

This repository is filled with helping code for UIDynamics stuff.



MFLAlphaCollision - Image To Boundary - Alpha Only Collisions
==================

This class will help you create a boundary behavior for any arbitrary image. It will trace any non zero alpha pixels in an image, and then construct a UIBezierPath from the result to use as a boundary.

MFLBoundaryPreview - Trace Boundaries
==================

This class will allow you to trace all on screen boundaries simply and easily to make it much easier to test your path drawing. Simply change the class of your UIView to MFLBoundaryPreview and it will do the rest of the work for you.
